QL gives you complete API for creating apps integrated with operating system. <br>
This gives you a possiblity to <b>create windows, manage audio, render images and much more.</b> 
<h1>How to use QL</h1>
<br>
For first you have to define ql::main(int argc, char** argv). If you dont wanna use ql's main you can define QL_GIVE_ME_MY_MAIN_BAKA. This will give you your main back.
If you are using your main, you have to use ql::init(int, char**), unless you like sigsegv ;).
QL has a complete collection of classes, which functions are descipted in comments. If you want to learn QL, you must dive into the code.
